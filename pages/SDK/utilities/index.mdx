# Overview

This section describes the various utility functions provided by the Stealth Address SDK. These functions facilitate low-level stealth address operations.

All utility functions can be imported from the sdk like so:

```ts
import { generateStealthAddress } from "@scopelift/stealth-address-sdk";
import { checkStealthAddress } from "@scopelift/stealth-address-sdk";
import { computeStealthKey } from "@scopelift/stealth-address-sdk";
```

## Scheme Id

The `schemeId` refers to the implementation scheme used for encoding a stealth meta-address, in which all stealth address functionality is dependent upon.

When using some functions, you will need to provide a `schemeId` when using the SDK. The `schemeId` is a number that represents the scheme used to generate the stealth address.

The default `schemeId` is 1 and currently is the only supported/valid scheme.

You can find more info about `schemeId` 1 [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5564).

When you need to pass in the `schemeId` to a function, you can get the valid `schemeId` enum type reference like so to ensure you are using a valid `schemeId`:

```ts
import { VALID_SCHEME_ID } from "@scopelift/stealth-address-sdk";
const schemeId = VALID_SCHEME_ID.SCHEME_ID_1;
```

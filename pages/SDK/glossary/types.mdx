# Types

Glossary of types in the Stealth Address SDK.

    ## `HexString`
    Signifies any length hexadecimal string, synonymous with `0x${string}`

    ## `VALID_SCHEME_ID`
    ```ts
    export enum VALID_SCHEME_ID {
      SCHEME_ID_1 = 1
    }
    ```
    Signifies a valid scheme id; the only valid scheme id is currently `1`.

    ## `Announce`
    The event emitted from the `announce` function call on the ERC-5564 contract.

    This is an informational solidity event definition and isn't an actual type provided in the SDK.

    ```solidity
    event Announcement(
      uint256 indexed schemeId,
      address indexed stealthAddress,
      address indexed caller,
      bytes ephemeralPubKey,
      bytes metadata
    );
    ```

    ## `EthAddress`
    Represents an Ethereum address.

    ## `VALID_CHAIN_IDS`
    Valid chain IDs for the SDK.

    A valid chain id has deployed `ERC5564Announcer` and `ERC6538Registry` contracts.

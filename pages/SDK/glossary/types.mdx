# Types

Glossary of types in the Stealth Address SDK.

    ## `HexString`
    Signifies any length hexadecimal string, synonymous with `0x${string}`

    ## `VALID_SCHEME_ID`
    ```ts
    export enum VALID_SCHEME_ID {
      SCHEME_ID_1 = 1
    }
    ```
    Signifies a valid scheme id; the only valid scheme id is currently `1`.

    ## `Announce`
    The event emitted from the `announce` function call on the ERC-5564 contract.

    This is an informational typescript type definition of the event and isn't an actual type provided in the SDK.

    ```ts
    export type Announce = {
      stealthAddress: EthAddress;
      ephemeralPublicKey: HexString;
      viewTag: HexString;
    }
    ```

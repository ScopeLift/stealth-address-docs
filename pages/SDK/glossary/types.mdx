# Types

Glossary of types in the Stealth Address SDK.

## `Announce`

The event emitted from the `announce` function call on the ERC-5564 contract.

This is an informational Solidity event definition and isn't an actual type provided in the SDK.

```solidity
event Announcement(
  uint256 indexed schemeId,
  address indexed stealthAddress,
  address indexed caller,
  bytes ephemeralPubKey,
  bytes metadata
);
```

## `AnnouncementArgs`

The arguments used to announce a stealth address.

[See Type](https://github.com/ScopeLift/stealth-address-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/actions/getAnnouncements/types.ts#L6)

## `AnnouncementLog`

The log data associated with the `Announce` event.

[See Type](https://github.com/ScopeLift/stealth-address-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/actions/getAnnouncements/types.ts#L12)

## `BlockType`

A block number as `bigint` or block tag.

```ts
bigint | "latest" | "earliest" | "pending" | "safe" | "finalized"
```

## `clientParams`

When passing in the `clientParams` object to an action, the following properties are required:

- `chainId`: The [chain ID](/#valid_chain_ids) of the network.
- `rpcUrl`: The RPC URL of the network.

## `EthAddress`

Represents an Ethereum address.

## `GetAnnouncementsForUserReturnType`

The return type of the `getAnnouncementsForUser` action, which is an array of announcements relevant to the specified user.

[See Type](https://github.com/ScopeLift/stealth-address-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/actions/getAnnouncementsForUser/types.ts#L14)

## `GetAnnouncementsReturnType`

The return type of the `getAnnouncements` action, which is an array of `Announce` event log data emitted from the `ERC5564Announcer` contract.

[See Type](https://github.com/ScopeLift/stealth-address-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/actions/getAnnouncements/types.ts#L27)

## `HexString`

Signifies any length hexadecimal string, synonymous with `0x${string}`

## `PrepareAnnounceArgs`

The arguments used to prepare an announcement.

[See Type](https://github.com/ScopeLift/stealth-address-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/actions/prepareAnnounce/types.ts#L14)

## `PreparePayload`

The prepared payload to send a transaction. This is the return type of the `prepare`-prefixed actions.

[See Type](https://github.com/ScopeLift/stealth-address-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/actions/types.ts#L9)

## `RegisterKeysOnBehalfArgs`

The arguments used to register a stealth meta-address (keys) on behalf of a user.

[See Type](https://github.com/ScopeLift/stealth-address-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/actions/prepareRegisterKeysOnBehalf/types.ts#L5)

## `VALID_CHAIN_IDS`

Valid chain IDs for the SDK.

A valid chain id has deployed `ERC5564Announcer` and `ERC6538Registry` contracts.

## `VALID_SCHEME_ID`

```ts
export enum VALID_SCHEME_ID {
  SCHEME_ID_1 = 1
}
```

Signifies a valid scheme id; the only valid scheme id is currently `1`.

## `WatchAnnouncementsForUserPollingOptions`

The polling options used to watch for announcements relevant to the user.

[See Type](https://github.com/ScopeLift/stealth-address-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/actions/watchAnnouncementsForUser/types.ts#L13)

## Overview

### Stealth Address SDK

The Stealth Address SDK provides developers a toolkit for integrating stealth transaction capabilities into Ethereum-based applications, supporting ERC-5564 and ERC-6538.

### Key Features

- **Stealth Address Utilities**: `generateStealthAddress` and `computeStealthKey` are examples of utility functions that help build up a stealth transaction. More info detailed in further sections.
- **Stealth Transaction Monitoring**: `watchAnnouncementsForUser` combines several important steps in a stealth transaction, such as watching for announcements relevant to a specific user.
- **Contract Interaction Preparation**: `prepare` functions simulate and return the payloads for key ERC-5564 and ERC-6538 contract interactions, such as `prepareRegisterKeys`, which prepares registering a stealth meta-address and outputs the required transaction payload (`to`, `from`, `data`).
- **Examples**: The SDK includes a variety of examples to help developers get started with stealth transactions.

### Use Cases

This SDK is built for developers looking to integrate stealth transactions into their applications, adding a layer of privacy into their apps.

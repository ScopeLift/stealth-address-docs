## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the installation and basic usage of the Stealth Address SDK, setting you up to integrate stealth transaction capabilities into your Ethereum-based applications.

### Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @scopelift/stealth-address-sdk
```

### Basic Usage

Generate a stealth address using the SDK, assuming you have a stealth meta-address (more info in further sections):

```ts
import { generateStealthAddress } from "@scopelift/stealth-address-sdk";

// The stealth meta-address URI Follows the format: "st:<chain>:<stealthMetaAddress>", where <chain> is the chain identifier (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3770#examples) and <stealthMetaAddress> is the stealth meta-address.
// You can also use the stealth meta-address directly, without the URI prefix.
const stealthMetaAddressURI = "...";

// Generate a stealth address using the default scheme (1)
// To learn more about the initial implementation scheme using SECP256k1, please see the reference here (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5564)
const result = generateStealthAddress({ stealthMetaAddressURI });

// Use the stealth address
console.log(result.stealthAddress);
```

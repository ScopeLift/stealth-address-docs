# Stealth Client

The stealth client provides a suite of actions that enable developers to handle various stealth address-related functionalities seamlessly.

Some example actions include:

**Announcement handling**:

- `getAnnouncements`: retrieves stealth address announcements emitted from the `ERC5564Announcer` contract
- `watchAnnouncementsForUser`: monitors stealth transaction announcements for a specified user

**Contract interaction preparation**:

- `prepareAnnounce`: prepares the payload to call the `announce` function on the `ERC5564Announcer` contract
- `prepareRegisterKeys`: prepares the payload to call the `registerKeys` function call on the `ERC6538Registry` contract

## Import

```ts
import { createStealthClient } from "@scopelift/stealth-address-sdk";
```

## Usage

Initialize a Stealth Client with your desired Chain ID (e.g. 1 for Ethereum) and RPC URL.

```ts
import { createStealthClient } from "@scopelift/stealth-address-sdk";

const stealthClient = createStealthClient({
  chainId,
  rpcUrl,
});
```

Then you can consume `StealthActions` from the `stealthClient` instance.

```ts
const announcements = await stealthClient.getAnnouncements(...args);
```

## Parameters

### chainId

- **Type:** [`VALID_CHAIN_IDS`](../glossary/types.md#valid_chain_ids)

  The ephemeral public key from the announcement.

```ts {2}
const stealthClient = createStealthClient({
  chainId,
  rpcUrl,
});
```

### rpcUrl

- **Type:** `string`

  The RPC URL of the network that corresponds to the provided `chainId`.

```ts {3}
const stealthClient = createStealthClient({
  chainId,
  rpcUrl,
});
```

# Overview

The SDK provides a suite of actions that enable developers to handle various stealth address-related functionalities seamlessly.

These actions can be consumed from an initialized `stealthClient` instance:

```ts
import { createStealthClient } from "@scopelift/stealth-address-sdk";

const stealthClient = createStealthClient({
  chainId,
  rpcUrl,
});

const announcements = await stealthClient.getAnnouncements(...args);
```

Or alternatively, you can call the action directly by passing the [`clientParams`](../glossary/types.md#clientparams) object with `chainId` and `rpcUrl`:

```ts
import { getAnnouncements } from "@scopelift/stealth-address-sdk";

const announcements = await getAnnouncements({
  clientParams: { chainId, rpcUrl },
  ...args,
});
```

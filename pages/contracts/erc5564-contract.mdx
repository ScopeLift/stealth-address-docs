# ERC5564Announcer.sol

## Overview

The `ERC5564Announcer` contract is designed to facilitate the broadcasting of transactions involving stealth addresses by emitting an `Announcement` event. This event contains relevant information that can be used to reconstruct the transaction and validate its parameters.

### Code: [`ERC5564Announcer.sol`](https://github.com/ScopeLift/stealth-address-erc-contracts/blob/b6f7d989b6247f81ceede5d1be2ffb23c1cb39b5/src/ERC5564Announcer.sol)

## Events

### Announcement

The `Announcement` event is emitted when the `announce` function is called. Here are the key components of this event:

- **schemeId** (`uint256`): Identifier corresponding to the applied stealth address scheme (e.g., `1` for `secp256k1` as specified in [ERC-5564](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5564)).
- **stealthAddress** (`address`): The computed stealth address for the recipient.
- **caller** (`address`): The address that called the `announce` function.
- **ephemeralPubKey** (`bytes`): Ephemeral public key used by the sender to derive the `stealthAddress`.
- **metadata** (`bytes`): Arbitrary data to emit with the event. The first byte MUST be the view tag. The remaining metadata can be used by the senders as per their requirements (refer to [ERC-5564](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5564) for recommended metadata structure).

#### Event Signature

```solidity
event Announcement(
  uint256 indexed schemeId,
  address indexed stealthAddress,
  address indexed caller,
  bytes ephemeralPubKey,
  bytes metadata
);
```

## Functions

### announce

The `announce` function is used by integrators to emit the `Announcement` event. It takes the following parameters:

- **schemeId** (`uint256`): Identifier corresponding to the applied stealth address scheme.
- **stealthAddress** (`address`): The computed stealth address for the recipient.
- **ephemeralPubKey** (`bytes`): The ephemeral public key used by the sender.
- **metadata** (`bytes`): Arbitrary data to emit with the event. The first byte MUST be the view tag. The remaining metadata can be used freely by the senders.

#### Function Signature

```solidity
function announce(
  uint256 schemeId,
  address stealthAddress,
  bytes memory ephemeralPubKey,
  bytes memory metadata
) external
```

#### Description

When called, this function emits the `Announcement` event with all the parameters supplied to it.

#### Usage

To use the `announce` function, you need to pass the required parameters as per the function signature:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    ERC5564Announcer public announcer;

    constructor(address announcerAddress) {
        announcer = ERC5564Announcer(announcerAddress);
    }

    function myAnnounceFunction(uint256 _schemeId, address _stealthAddress, bytes memory _ephemeralPubKey, bytes memory _metadata) public {
        announcer.announce(_schemeId, _stealthAddress, _ephemeralPubKey, _metadata);
    }
}
```

# Overview

## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview and detailed information about the contracts and interfaces related to the stealth address and meta-address mechanisms defined in the ERC-5564 and ERC-6538 standards. The documentation is divided into the following sections:

1. [**ERC5564Announcer**](/contracts/erc5564-contract)
2. [**IERC5564Announcer**](/contract-interfaces/erc5564-interface)
3. [**ERC6538Registry**](/contracts/erc6538-contract)
4. [**IERC6538Registry**](/contract-interfaces/erc6538-interface)
5. [**Deployment Addresses**](/contracts/deployments)

## Overview of Contracts and Interfaces

### ERC5564Announcer

The `ERC5564Announcer` contract is designed to facilitate the broadcasting of transactions involving stealth addresses by emitting an `Announcement` event. It provides the following functionalities:

- Emitting an `Announcement` event with details about transactions involving stealth addresses.
- Functions for integrators to call and emit these events.

#### Documentation:

- [ERC5564Announcer.sol](/contracts/erc5564-contract)

### IERC5564Announcer

The `IERC5564Announcer` interface defines the standard for calling the `ERC5564Announcer` contract. It includes the signature of the `announce` function and the declaration of the `Announcement` event.

#### Documentation:

- [IERC5564Announcer](/contract-interfaces/erc5564-interface)

### ERC6538Registry

The `ERC6538Registry` contract maps accounts to their stealth meta-addresses, enabling the registration and management of these addresses. Key functionalities include:

- Registering and updating stealth meta-addresses for different address schemes.
- Handling nonces to validate signatures and prevent reuse.
- Emitting events when stealth meta-addresses are set or nonces are incremented.

#### Documentation:

- [ERC6538Registry.sol](/contracts/erc6538-contract)

### IERC6538Registry

The `IERC6538Registry` interface defines the standard for interacting with the `ERC6538Registry` contract. It includes function signatures for registering keys, incrementing nonces, retrieving meta-addresses, and handling events.

#### Documentation:

- [IERC6538Registry](/contract-interfaces/erc6538-interface)

### Contract Addresses

This section provides the contract addresses for the deployed instances of the `ERC5564Announcer` and `ERC6538Registry` contracts. These addresses are essential for integrators and users interacting with the actual deployed contracts on different networks (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, testnets).
